\description{
This function will search for differentially methylated CpG sites,
  which are regarded as possible functional regions involved
  in gene transcriptional regulation.
  In order to find these regions we use the beta-values (methylation values
  ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) to compare two groups.
  Firstly, it calculates the difference between the mean methylation of each
  group for each probes. Secondly, it calculates the p-value using the
  wilcoxon test using the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment method.
  The default parameters will require a minimum absolute beta values delta
  of 0.2 and a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum P-value
  of <0.01 for the difference.
  After these analysis, we save a volcano plot (x-axis:diff mean methylation,
  y-axis: significance) that will help the user identify the differentially
  methylated CpG sites and return the object with the calculus in the rowRanges.
