\title{Download GDC data}
\usage{
GDCdownload(query, token.file, method = "api", directory = "GDCdata",
  chunks.per.download = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A query for GDCquery function}

\item{token.file}{Token file to download controled data (only for method = "client")}

\item{method}{Uses the API (POST method) or gdc client tool. Options "api", "client".
API is faster, but the data might get corrupted in the download, and it might need to be executed again}

\item{directory}{Directory/Folder where the data was downloaded. Default: GDCdata}

\item{chunks.per.download}{This will make the API method only download n (chunks.per.download) files at a time.
This may reduce the download problems when the data size is too large. Expected a integer number (example chunks.per.download = 6)}
}
\value{
Shows the output from the GDC transfer tools
}
\description{
Uses GDC API or GDC transfer tool to download gdc data
  The user can use query argument
  The data from query will be save in a folder: project/data.category
}
