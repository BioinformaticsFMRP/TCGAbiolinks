\value{
A dataframe with the Composite.Element.REF and
        the group it was classified
         group 1 = Not Significant
         group 2 = Hypermethylated
         group 3 = Hypomethylated
}
\description{
In order to searches for the probes that are different methylated and
  are significant, we use a volcano plot (x-axis:diff mean methylation,
  y-axis: significance) that compares the methylation data between the two groups.
  Firstly, it calculates the difference between the mean methylation of each group
for each probes. After, it calculates the p-value using the wilcoxon test
using the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment method. With both values, it is possible
to analyse the data.
