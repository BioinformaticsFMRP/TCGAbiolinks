\title{survival analysis (SA) univariate with Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.}
\usage{
TCGAanalyze_SurvivalKM(clinical_patient, dataGE, Genelist, Survresult,
  ThreshTop = 0.67, ThreshDown = 0.33, p.cut = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{clinical_patient}{is a data.frame using function 'clinic' with information
related to barcode / samples such as bcr_patient_barcode, days_to_death ,
days_to_last_follow_up , vital_status, etc}

\item{dataGE}{is a matrix of Gene expression (genes in rows, samples in cols) from TCGAprepare}

\item{Genelist}{is a list of gene symbols where perform survival KM.}

\item{Survresult}{is a parameter (default = FALSE) if is TRUE will show KM plot and results.}

\item{ThreshTop}{is a quantile threshold to identify samples with high expression of a gene}

\item{ThreshDown}{is a quantile threshold to identify samples with low expression of a gene}

\item{p.cut}{p.values threshold. Default: 0.05}
}
\value{
table with survival genes pvalues from KM.
}
\description{
TCGAanalyze_SurvivalKM perform an univariate Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis (SA).
It performed Kaplan-Meier survival univariate using complte follow up with all days
taking one gene a time from Genelist of gene symbols.
For each gene according its level of mean expression in cancer samples,
defining two thresholds for quantile
expression of that gene in all samples (default ThreshTop=0.67,ThreshDown=0.33) it is possible
to define a threshold of intensity of gene expression to divide the samples in 3 groups
(High, intermediate, low).
TCGAanalyze_SurvivalKM performs SA between High and low groups using following functions
from survival package
\enumerate{
\item survival::Surv
\item survival::survdiff
\item survival::survfit
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 clinical_patient_Cancer <- TCGAquery_clinic("brca","clinical_patient")
 dataBRCAcomplete <- log2(BRCA_rnaseqv2)
 # Selecting only 10 genes for example
 dataBRCAcomplete <- dataBRCAcomplete[1:10,]
 tabSurvKM<-TCGAanalyze_SurvivalKM(clinical_patient_Cancer,dataBRCAcomplete,
 Genelist = rownames(dataBRCAcomplete), Survresult = FALSE,ThreshTop=0.67,ThreshDown=0.33)
}
