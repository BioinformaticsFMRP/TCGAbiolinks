\title{TCGAanalyze_Filtering}
\usage{
TCGAanalyze_Filtering(TableRnaseq, QuantileThresh)
}
\arguments{
\item{TableRnaseq}{is a dataframe or numeric matrix, each row represents a gene,
each column represents a sample come from TCGAPrepare}

\item{QuantileThresh}{is threshold selected as mean for filtering}
}
\value{
A filtered dataframe or numeric matrix where each row represents a gene,
each column represents a sample
}
\description{
TCGAanalyze_Filtering allows user to filter mRNA transcripts and miRNA,
   selecting a threshold. For istance returns all mRNA or miRNA with mean across all
   samples, higher than the threshold defined quantile mean across all samples.
}
\examples{
dataNorm <- TCGAbiolinks::TCGAanalyze_Normalization(dataBRCA, geneInfo)
dataFilt <- TCGAanalyze_Filtering(dataNorm, 0.25)
