TCGAbiolinks 0.99.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
  FIRST VERSION - FEATURES

  SEARCH:
-----------------------
* TCGAQuery: searches TCGA open-access data through a preprocessed table with the latest version of the files.
* TCGAsocial: Finds the number of downloads of a package on CRAN or BIOC
* TCGAinvestigate:Find most studied TF in pubmed related to a specific cancer, disease, or tissue
* TCGAVersion: shows a summary (version, date, number of samples, size of the data) of all versions of data for a given tumor and platform.

  DOWNLOAD:
-----------------------
* TCGADownload: The TCGADownload function will download the data using as reference the lines of the TCGAQuery search result.
* clinic: Get the clinical information

  PREPARING THE DATA:
-----------------------
* TCGAPrepare:This function will read the data from level 3 the experiments and prepare it for downstream analysis into a SummarizedExperiment object.
* RnaSeqNormalization: RnaSeqNormalization

  ANALYSIS:
-----------------------
* meanMethylationAnalysis:  Creates a mean methylation boxplot divided in by groups
* plotPCAforGroups: plotPCAforGroups
* starburstAnalysis:Creates a starburst plot
* volcanoAnalysis: In order to search for the probes that are different methylated and are significant, we use a volcano plot (x-axis:diff mean methylation, y-axis: significance) that compares the methylation data between the two groups. Firstly, it calculates the difference between the mean methylation of each group for each probes. After, it calculates the p-value using the wilcoxon test using the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment method.
* CreateTabLevel: CreateTabLevel for Differentially expression analysis (DEA)
* DEArnaSEQ: Perform DEA to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). It is possible to do a two-class analysis.
* survivalAnalysis: Creates a survival plot from TCGA patient clinical data using survival library. It uses the fields days_to_death and vital, plus a columns for groups. (I'll take a look, maybe we have made the same function[SurvivalCoxNET, SurvivalKMunivariate, survivalAnalysis])
* SurvivalCoxNET: Survival analysis with univariate Cox regression package (dnet)
* SurvivalKMunivariate: Survival table with univariate Kaplan-Meier
* TCGApreprocessing:Plot with array array intensity correlation and boxplot of correlation samples by samples. No example and it is not in the vignette.

  OTHER:
-----------------------
* GenesCutID : Get the gene_symbol from annotations like ?|1032332,AML2|103434. (I think that exporting this function is useless,  It is almost the same as strsplit.)
* TCGAintegrate: Common samples among platforms with 2 by 2 comparison (This function verifies if a sample is from the same patient? If so, is it useful to have an n vs n matrix with no header or rows?)
* ggbiplot: Biplot for Principal Components using ggplot2
* EAbarplot: EAbarplot (Needs a better description)
* EAcomplete: EAcomplete (Needs a better description)

  FILTER FUNCTIONS:
-----------------------
We need a better description for these functions. Also, when you call '_BRCA' it works only with BRCA clinical data? Maybe I'm wrong, but some of these functions are not the same as subsetting the clinical data frame?
* RnaSeqFilt:Filtering rnaseq by quantile
* samplesfilter: Filtering sample output from TCGAQuery (Almost the same as strsplit. Is it useful?)
* stage_BRCA: stage_BRCA
* ER_status_BRCA: ER_status_BRCA
* HER_status_BRCA: HER_status_BRCA
* MatchedCoupledSampleTypes: MatchedCoupledSampleTypes
* MultiSampleTypes: MultiSampleTypes
* PR_status_BRCA: PR_status_BRCA
* gender_BRCA: gender_BRCA
* SampleTypes: For a given list of samples and a type sample, return the samples that are from that type.
