CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Add GISTIC2 information and Mutation information in the summarizedExperiment while preparing GDC data

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES
    o Speed up GDCquery

TCGAbiolinks 2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------
* GDC functions added (GDCquery, GDCdownload, GDCprepare,
GDCquery_Maf, GDCprepare_clinic)
* Removed TCGAquery_investigate, TCGAprofile_plot

TCGAbiolinks 1.3.6
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Starting to move the code to GDC data portal

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.26
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: TCGAprepare for  IlluminaHiSeq_miRNASeq platform was
not considering all file types

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.26
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: TCGAprepare for  IlluminaHiSeq_miRNASeq platform was
not considering all file types

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.25
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: TCGAquery_maf had a bug if only one table was found.
TCGAbiolinks 1.1.24
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: types argument for Genome_Wide_SNP_6 was not working.

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.23
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: logFC result from TCGAanalyze_DEA for method "glmLRT" was
considerent the alphabetical order of groups, which migth induce the user to error

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.22
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: when  checking the data integrity, manifest was being read
with argument header = T,but it should be false.


TCGAbiolinks 1.1.21
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Improvement: TCGADownload checks for data integrity.

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.20
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing subseting was incorrect in case there
were outliers.

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.19
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: preparing the data for "IlluminaGA_DNASeq" platform and
TCGAquery_maf had a problem for some files.

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.18
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Update lgg and gbm subtype information. Source: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.028

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.17
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Adding batch information to the package. batch.info object is available for user
and TCGAprepare adds automtically info for the summarizedExperiment object
* TCGAvisualize_starburst new parameter: circle, to draw or not the circles in the plot
* Database update

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.16
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix: subsetByOverlaps was removed from SummarizedExperiment package
TCGAbiolinks should not import it
* Small fixes in documentation
* TCGAanalyze_DMR is now saving the results in a cvs file


TCGAbiolinks 1.1.15
---------------------------------------------------------------
* ggplot2 updat broke the package. Some small fixes were made, but
the function TCGAvisualize_profilePlot is not working as sjPlot is not updated yet.
* small fixes in documentation

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.14
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Change in TCGAvisualize_Heatmap: coloring the columns by patient might give
wrong results if patient has more than one sample in the hetamap.
To solve that we added the possibility to use the sample columns and we added a warning
if there is more than one sample for the patients and a patient column is being used.

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.11 - 1.1.13
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Update in the citation

TCGAbiolinks 1.1.10
----------------------------------------------------------------
* TCGAPrepare: bug fix for bt.exon_quantification files from IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2 platform
* Database update

  TCGAbiolinks 1.1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------
* TCGAvisualize_Heatmap Now it is using Heatmap plus package and is calculating z-cores
* TCGAvisualize_profilePlot  Visualize the distribution of subgroups in the groups distributions
* Database update
* From version 1.0: small bugs corrections in some plots and TCGAprepare_elmer, documentation improvement.

  TCGAbiolinks 0.99.2
