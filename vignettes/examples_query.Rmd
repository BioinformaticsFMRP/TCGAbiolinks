There are two available sources to download GDC data using TCGAbiolunks:
- GDC Legacy Archive : provides access to an unmodified copy of data that was previously stored in
  [CGHub](https://cghub.ucsc.edu/) and in the TCGA Data Portal hosted by the TCGA Data Coordinating Center (DCC), in which uses
  as references GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh36 (hg18).
- GDC harmonized database: data available was harmonized against GRCh38 (hg38) using GDC Bioinformatics Pipelines
  which provides methods to the standardization of biospecimen and
  clinical data.

## Recurrent tumor samples

In this example we will access the harmonized database (`legacy = FALSE`) and search for all DNA methylation data for recurrent glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and low grade gliomas (LGG) samples.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query <- GDCquery(project = c("TCGA-GBM", "TCGA-LGG"),
                  data.category = "DNA Methylation",
                  legacy = FALSE,
                  platform = c("Illumina Human Methylation 450"),
                  sample.type = "Recurrent Solid Tumor"
)
datatable(query$results[[1]], 
              filter = 'top',
              options = list(scrollX = TRUE, keys = TRUE, pageLength = 5), 
              rownames = FALSE)
```



## Finding the match between file names and barcode for Controlled data.

This exmaple shows how the user can search for breast cancer Raw Sequencing Data ("Controlled") 
and verify the name of the files and the barcodes associated with it.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query <- GDCquery(project = c("TCGA-BRCA"),
                  data.category = "Raw Sequencing Data",  
                  sample.type = "Primary solid Tumor")
# Only first 100 to make render faster
datatable(query$results[[1]][1:100,c("file_name","cases")], 
              filter = 'top',
              options = list(scrollX = TRUE, keys = TRUE, pageLength = 5), 
              rownames = FALSE)
```
