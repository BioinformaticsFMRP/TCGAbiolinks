# Introduction


TCGAbiolinksGUI was created to help users more comfortable with graphical user interfaces (GUI) to search, download and analyze Cancer data. 
It offers a graphical user interface to the R/Bioconductor package 
[TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks/) [@TCGAbiolinks], 
which is able to access The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) through its  
[GDC Application Programming Interface (API)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-application-programming-interface-api).
Additional packages from Bioconductor are included, such as [maftools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/maftools/) [@mayakonda2016maftools] and [ComplexHeatmap](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/)  [@Gu20052016] packages to aid in visualizing the mutation data, 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) [@yao2015inferring] to 
identify regulatory enhancers using gene expression + DNA methylation data + motif analysis, 
[Pathview](http://bioconductor.org/packages/pathview/) [@luo2013pathview] for pathway-based data integration and visualization,
and [minfi](http://bioconductor.org/packages/minfi/) for the processing of DNA methylation raw idat files.

The GUI was created using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), 
a Web Application Framework for R, and uses
several packages to provide advanced features that can enhance Shiny apps, 
such as [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) to add JavaScript actions for the app,
[shinydashboard](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard) to add dashboards 
and [shinyFiles](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) to provide an API 
for client side access to the server file system. 
A running version of the GUI is found in [http://tcgabiolinks.fmrp.usp.br:3838/](http://tcgabiolinks.fmrp.usp.br:3838/)

This work has been supported by a grant from Henry Ford Hospital (H.N.) and by 
the São Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP](http://www.fapesp.br/) (2016/01389-7 
to T.C.S. & H.N. and 2015/07925-5 to H.N.) the BridgeIRIS project, funded by INNOVIRIS, 
Region de Bruxelles Capitale, Brussels, Belgium, and by GENomic profiling of 
Gastrointestinal Inflammatory-Sensitive CANcers (GENGISCAN), Belgian FNRS PDR 
(T100914F to A.C., C.O. & G.B.). T.C.S. and B.P.B. were supported by the NCI 
Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program, NIH/NCI grant 1U01CA184826.

# Starting with TCGAbiolinksGUI 

## Installation 

To install the package from the [Bioconductor repository](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinksGUI/) please use the following
code. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("TCGAbiolinksGUI", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version of the package via GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
devtools::install_github("BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinksGUI.data",ref = "R_3.4")
devtools::install_github("BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinksGUI")
```

### Increasing loaded DLL

<div class="panel panel-danger">
<div class="panel-heading"> Increasing loaded DLL</div>
<div class="panel-body">

If you receive this error message:  `maximal number of DLLs reached...`
You will need to increase the maximum number of DLL R can load wit the
enriroment variable `R_MAX_NUM_DLLS`.

For MACOS please modify the file `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Renviron`
and add `R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150` in the end. Or you can run in R the following command as R administrator:
`system(' echo "R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150" >> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Renviron')`

For UBUNTU please modify the file `/usr/lib/R/etc/Renviron` and add `R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150` in the end.
Or you can run in R the following command as R administrator:
`system(' echo "R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150" >> /usr/lib/R/etc/Renviron')`

For other OS check https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/Startup.html.

## Docker image

TCGAbiolinksGUI is available as Docker image (self-contained environments that contain everything needed to run the software), 
which can be easily run on Mac OS, Windows and Linux systems. 

The image can be obtained from Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/tiagochst/tcgabiolinksgui/

For more information please check: https://docs.docker.com/ and https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/

### Setting up image using graphical user interface (GUI) 

This [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0-8N2fjttG-QXp5LVlPQnVQejg) 
shows how to install and execute the image using [kitematic](https://kitematic.com/), which
offers a  graphical user interface (GUI) to control your app containers.

### Setting up image using command-line 

- Download image: docker pull tiagochst/tcgabiolinksgui
- To run RStudio Server and shiny-server, but the data is not saved if the container is stopped: 
`sudo docker run --name tcgabiolinksgui -d -P -v /home/$USER/docker:/home/rstudio -p 3333:8787 -p 3334:3838 tiagochst/tcgabiolinksgui`
1. For more information how data can be saved please read [this wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/How-to-save-data) and see command below 

- To run RStudio Server, shiny-server and save the results in the host machine please use the code below: 
`sudo docker run --name tcgabiolinksgui -d -P -v /home/$USER/docker:/home/rstudio -p 3333:8787 -p 3334:3838 tiagochst/tcgabiolinksgui`
 1. In case Rstudio is not accessible please check if the folder created (docker) has the right permission
 2. If your system is windows or macOS you will need to change  `/home/$USER/docker` 
 to the correct system path. Examples can be found in this [github page](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Sharing-files-with-host-machine)

- To stop the image:
1. Run  `sudo docker stop tcgabiolinksgui` to stop it

- To start the image again (after the first time ran with `docker run` and stopped).
1. Run  `sudo docker start tcgabiolinksgui` 

### Accessing the tools after the image is running:

- TCGAbiolinksGUI will be available at <your local IP>:3334/tcgabiolinksgui
- RStudio will be available at <your local IP>:3333 (***username: rstudio*** , ***password:rstudio***)

## Quick start

The following commands should be used to start the graphical user interface.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(TCGAbiolinksGUI)
TCGAbiolinksGUI()
```
